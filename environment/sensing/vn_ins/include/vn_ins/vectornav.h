 * \section DESCRIPTION
 * This header file includes all of the header file inclusions needed to use
 * all of the features of the VectorNav C/C++ Library.
 *
 * \mainpage VectorNav C/C++ Library
 * The VectorNav C/C++ Library allows interfacing with VectorNav's orientation
 * and inertial sensor products.
 *
 * \section Samples
 * The folder <em>samples</em> contains sample projects that can be immediately
 * compiled in various environments. The following sections walk through compiling
 * and running the samples provided.
 *
 * \subsection vn100LinuxSample Linux Sample (VN-100)
 * This samples illustrates how to setup an environment for compiling the VectorNav
 * C/C++ Library for use with a VN-100 device.
 *
 * -# Open the file <tt>main.c</tt> and change the configuration defines at the
 *    top to your environment specifics.
 *     - For the COM_PORT define, normal physical COM ports typically will be
 *       in the form of <tt>/dev/ttyS1</tt>. If you are using an FTDI
 *       USB-to-Serial chip (typically found on USB cables supplied with VN-100
 *       Rugged Kits or on a VN-100 Development Board), the necessary drivers
 *       are already include in kernel version 2.6.31 and later and can be
 *       accessed in the form of <tt>/dev/ttyUSB0</tt>.
 *     - For the BAUD_RATE define, change it to the currently saved baudrate
 *       speed of your VectorNav device.
 * -# From a terminal window, browse to the folder <em>samples/vn100_linux</em> and
 *    compile by typing the command <tt>make</tt>.
 * -# The sample program may then be run by executing the command <tt>./main</tt> .
 *        - Some Linux flavors may require administrative access to the COM
 *          port. If you receive an error message indicating invalid access
 *          privileges, try exeucting the command as <tt>sudo ./main</tt> .

 * \example vn100_windows_basic.c
 * Here is an example of using compling the library on Windows using Microsoft's
 * Visual Studio to access a VN-100 device. This example will open a connection to a VN-100 device,
 * display the current yaw, pitch, roll attitude for ten seconds, and then
 * close the connection to the device. Note that in this examples, the thread calling
 * the function \ref vn100_getYawPitchRoll will block for several milliseconds while the
 * underlying function mechanisms sends a request to the VN-100 sensor over the
 * serial port and waits for a response. If it is important to not block the thread,
 * consider only retrieving the latest asynchronous data packet received from the
 * sensor by calling the function \ref vn100_getCurrentAsyncData. An example of
 * using this function may be found in \ref vn100_windows_async_easy.c "vn100_windows_async_easy.c".

 *
 * \example vn100_windows_async.c
 * This example shows how to register a callback function with the library which
 * is called whenever new asynchronous data is received from a VN-100 sensor. Since
 * the callback function will be called on a different thread than the user's main
 * thread, some level of thread sychronization techniques may be needed to prevent
 * memory corruption. An alternative to this method may be found in
 * \ref vn100_windows_async_easy.c "vn100_windows_async.c" which removes the need for the
 * user to worry about thread synchronization issues.
 *
 * In this example, the main user's thread connects to the VN-100 sensor and
 * then registers a callback function. The main user's thread sleeps for 10
 * seconds and all callbacks printout the received yaw, pitch, roll.

 * This example shows how to retrieve the lastest asynchronous data packet received
 * from the VN-100 sensor by using the function \ref vn100_getCurrentAsyncData. This
 * function is useful since it does not block while a command transaction is performed
 * with the sensor. The library's backend thread is constantly servicing the COM port
 * and when asychronous data is received from the sensor, it saves a copy in memory
 * making it immediately accessible on the call to \ref vn100_getCurrentAsyncData.
